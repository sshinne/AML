Hello, this document is intended for the **FPES program**, the **AML course**, and the *Computational Skills module*.

We are supposed to describe 3 data formats useful in earth science and ecology, specifically:

 1. its key characteristics, 
 2. some history and 
 3. a few tools by which this data type can be handled/visualized etc.
 
 The Excel spreadsheet is commonly used in all scientific fields to manage, store and analyze data.
